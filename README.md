#### Self-Assessment

  * Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

    * The idea that we are almost done with our course terrifies me.  I don't feel ready to go out into the workplace and that I'm not good enough.  I am always looking around at my classmates and feeling that they're doing better than me.  Maybe this means I need to work harder by using extra resources to improve my skills.  My soft skills also need improvement; often I am too timid during conversation, or I am too abrasive and I can't find a balance between the two.  More white-boarding could help with this.



  * Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

    * I just don't feel ready for that transition and am drowning in not feeling good enough for this.  My classmates all have college educations, and I used to be a bouncer, how do I compete with that?  My longest work experience on LinkedIn is as emergency room registration, and I was miserable doing that but everyone keeps telling me that that is the spot I should make shine.  I need a way to make myself more appealing to future employers.
