#### Self-Assessment

  * Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

    * The idea that we are almost done with our course terrifies me.  I don't feel ready to go out into the workplace and that I'm not good enough.  I am always looking around at my classmates and feeling that they're doing better than me.  Maybe this means I need to work harder by using extra resources to improve my skills.  My soft skills also need improvement; often I am too timid during conversation, or I am too abrasive and I can't find a balance between the two.  More white-boarding could help with this.



  * Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

    * I just don't feel ready for that transition and am drowning in not feeling good enough for this.  My classmates all have college educations, and I used to be a bouncer, how do I compete with that?  My longest work experience on LinkedIn is as emergency room registration, and I was miserable doing that but everyone keeps telling me that that is the spot I should make shine.  I need a way to make myself more appealing to future employers.

#### Plan

I need to focus on skill development, especially with vanilla javascript.  I should spend time working through video tutorials and reading documentation.  I will post links and images in this README as well.

I am passionate about game development, and ultimately that is where I want my career to go.  I should look into local meetups and game jams so that I can network and gain experience working on games.

My Github needs to be cleaned up quite a lot.  There are files with commented out code, and many repositories do not have READMEs.  To resolve this I will spend time working through my projects adding READMEs and pruning content.

My LinkedIn has typos and grammatical errors as well as unpolished content.  I need to craft my profile to present myself like a valuable asset.

It looks like my plan for my capstone project might fall through.  I have tried to contact Nick and Sadie from Rune and Board, but have not had a reply.  I have also requested their permission to redesign their website as just a portfolio piece but have not heard back.  Without their consent I do not feel comfortable working on that project and should look into alternatives that I am also passionate about.

My project from last Friday is also incomplete and I need that to be submitted before today is over.
